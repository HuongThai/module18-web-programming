# Exercise-1
In this exercise, you'll practice working with HTML and SVG syntax.

You can complete this exercise through the following steps:

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account

2. Clone the repository to your machine

3. Open the `index.html` file in a browser. You can double-click on the file to open it, but I instead recommend you run a local webserver:

	```
	cd /path/to/exercise
	python -m http.server
	```

	View the page at <http://localhost:8000>.

4. Edit the `index.html` file to complete the exercise. Refresh the web page you opened to see the results.

5. When you're done, `add` and `commit` your changes

6. Push your changes back to GitHub to save your work
